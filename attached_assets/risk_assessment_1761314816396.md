# Risk Assessment: Legacy-to-ISO 20022 Transformation

## Executive Summary

This risk assessment identifies critical challenges in transforming legacy payment messages (SWIFT MT103 and NACHA CCD) to ISO 20022 XML format. Key risks include data loss, compliance gaps, and operational disruptions during the transition period.

---

## 1. DATA LOSS AND MAPPING RISKS

### 1.1 Missing Address Information (NACHA → ISO 20022)
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Description**: NACHA CCD format does not contain detailed address information for debtor or creditor, while ISO 20022 expects structured postal addresses.

**Impact**:
- Potential rejection by receiving banks requiring complete address data
- Compliance issues with AML/KYC requirements
- Reduced straight-through processing (STP) rates

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement address enrichment service using customer database lookups
- Maintain separate customer master data repository
- Add data validation layer to flag missing addresses before transformation
- Establish fallback protocols for incomplete address data
- Consider using "Address Unknown" or "On File" indicators with proper documentation

### 1.2 Field Truncation and Length Limitations
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Legacy formats have different field length constraints than ISO 20022. Names, addresses, and remittance information may exceed or fall short of expected lengths.

**Impact**:
- Data truncation leading to incomplete information
- Potential payment routing errors
- Customer service issues from unclear payment details

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement field length validation during parsing
- Establish abbreviation standards for long names/addresses
- Log all truncation events for audit trail
- Provide overflow handling (multiple XML elements if supported)
- Create transformation rules for common truncation scenarios

### 1.3 Ambiguous Data Interpretation
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Legacy formats use free-text fields that may contain multiple data types. For example, SWIFT MT103 :50K: may contain account number, name, and address in various formats.

**Impact**:
- Incorrect field mapping leading to payment failures
- Misidentification of party information
- Manual intervention required, reducing automation benefits

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Develop comprehensive parsing rules with regular expressions
- Implement ML-based data classification for ambiguous fields
- Create extensive test dataset covering format variations
- Establish data quality checkpoints with manual review queues
- Document all assumptions made during parsing

## 3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION RISKS

### 3.1 Character Encoding and Special Characters
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Legacy formats may use different character encodings (EBCDIC, ASCII) than XML's UTF-8, leading to corruption of special characters, accents, or non-Latin scripts.

**Impact**:
- Garbled text in names, addresses, or remittance information
- Payment rejections due to invalid characters
- Loss of critical information

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement robust character encoding detection and conversion
- Establish character substitution rules (e.g., ö → o, ñ → n)
- Validate XML output against schema for character compliance
- Create whitelist of acceptable characters per field
- Log all character substitutions for review

### 3.2 Date and Time Handling
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Different date formats and timezone handling between legacy and ISO 20022 can cause processing errors or timing issues.

**Impact**:
- Incorrect settlement dates
- Missed cut-off times
- Payment delays or failures

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Standardize on UTC/ISO 8601 format for all timestamps
- Implement timezone conversion with explicit source/target timezone logging
- Validate date ranges (no future dates beyond reasonable limits)
- Handle edge cases: leap years, month-end rollovers, daylight saving time
- Test extensively with historical date data

### 3.3 XML Schema Validation
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Description**: Generated ISO 20022 XML may be structurally valid but semantically incorrect or fail schema validation.

**Impact**:
- Payment rejections by receiving systems
